Gtm Module Link Cartridge
======

## Introduction

The aim of this module is to facilitate GTM integration. By adding it in your project you will be able to 
have GTM include in your header and a set of e-commerce tags pre-defined. You can add or update tags but 
normally all MVP ones are already handled.
