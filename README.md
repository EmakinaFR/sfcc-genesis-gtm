The aim of this module is to facilitate GTM integration. By adding it in your project you will be able to 
have GTM included in your header and a set of e-commerce tags pre-defined. You can add or update tags but 
normally all MVP ones are already handled.

📦 Installation
---------------

You can follow the installation part inside the `documentation` directory.

⚙ Configuration
----------------

The configuration is the same for both Site Genesis and SFRA websites. You just have to 
follow these instructions:
- compress the "metadata" folder into a zip file (metadata.zip)
- log into your Business Manager
- go to ​Administration > Site Development > Site Import & Export
- upload the metadata.zip file
- import it
